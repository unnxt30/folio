Hi, I’m a third-year Computer Science & Engineering student at Shiv Nadar University with a passion for solving challenging problems. My main programming language is Go, and I’m currently diving into systems programming through the book [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

I’m on the lookout for opportunities where I can contribute to solving real-world problems and see the impact of my work in action.

### What I Love:
- **Programming:** Go, Docker, Cloud, Systems Programming  
- **Miscellaneous:** Reading, movies, football, and, of course, coffee!  

Let’s connect and create something meaningful together!
